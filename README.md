# SnakeCamel

This Gem provides several ways for conversation between CamalCase and snake_case.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'snake_camel'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install snake_camel


## Methods

  - snakecase

  - snakecase!

  - camelcase

  - camelcase!


## Usage

  You have several ways to use it, it's pretty simple. Choose one, based on your need!

  - If you don't care about what's under the hood:

  ```ruby
  require 'snake_camel'

  'SnakeCamel'.snakecase #=> 'snake_camel'

  or

  'snake_camel'.camelcase #=> 'SnakeCamel'
  ```

  - If you don't want to monkey-patch your String class:

```ruby
require 'snake_camel/instance_methods'

foo = 'FooBar'
foo.extend SnakeCamel::InstanceMethods

foo.snakecase #=> 'foo_bar'

or

foo = 'foo_bar'
foo.extend SnakeCamel::InstanceMethods

foo.camelcase #=> 'FooBar'
```
- And you can use it like a regular method:

```ruby
require 'snake_camel/methods'

SnakeCamel::Methods.snakecase('FooBar') #=> 'foo_bar'

SnakeCamel::Methods.camelcase('foo_bar') #=> 'FooBar'
```


## Creator's notes

I know there are other gems that provide the same functionality as SnakeCamel, but I want to create something more gentle, more simple.
